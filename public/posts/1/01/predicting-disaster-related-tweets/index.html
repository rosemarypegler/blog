<h2>Introduction + Data</h2>
<p>This notebook has been produced as part of my first Kaggle competition. We are provided with a dataset containing around 7,000 tweets which may or may not relate to a real disaster that has occurred. There are only two other variables; <code>keyword</code> which contains a disaster-related keyword (or NA) and <code>location</code> which details the provided location of the tweet (also can be NA). The task is to build a classification model that predicts on unlabelled data.</p>
<p>The below table shows the first 100 posts in the training dataset.</p>

<p>As the dataset contains just 3 predictors, the first stage is to add variables which I believe could - emphasis on could - have some predictive power. The information I have added is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the tweet contains a fullstop, link, exclamation mark, question mark, hashtag, number, tag (@), or swear word.</li>
<li>Whether the location contains a comma. The reasoning behind this is that I hypothesised that locations containing a comma like “London, UK” could signify more legitimate locations and subsequently legitimate disasters.</li>
<li>Number of hastags, tags and links.</li>
<li>Number of words in the location and text variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Processing of the terms comes later in the process.</p>

<h2>Data Preparation</h2>
<p>The first stage of preparation for modelling is to split the data into a training and testing set, stratified by the target variable. The training set is subsequently split into 10 folds for the modelling process.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1)

vectors_reduced &lt;- 
  vectors %&gt;%
  rename(token = &quot;V1&quot;) %&gt;%
  tibble()</code></pre>
<p>The data then goes through various pre-processing steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>location</code> variable is tokenised then filtered for the top 100 terms. These terms are converted into single variables within the dataset with the value equal to the term frequency for each document.</li>
<li>The <code>text</code> variable is tokenised then transformed using word embeddings. I have used pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe in an attempt to capture the relationship between terms so the model can locate differences in language between text in disaster and non-disaster tweets.</li>
<li>The length of the <code>text</code> and <code>location</code> variables are right-skewed so these are log-transformed.</li>
<li>Anything classed as NA in the <code>keyword</code> variable is categorised into a new category called “unknown”. The <code>keyword</code> variable is then transformed into dummy variables.</li>
<li>The <code>target</code> variable is unbalanced - there are around 1,000 more posts categorised as non-disaster - so new samples of disaster tweets are created using nearest neighbours.</li>
