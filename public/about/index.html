<p>After completing my masters at the University of Manchester in 2020, I started working for a company that encourages creativity. And with the pandemic causing several lockdowns, I finally had time to pick up that paintbrush that was put down too many years ago.</p>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s purpose is to showcase my non-work related projects.</p>
