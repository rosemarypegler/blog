      <description>AirBnB DataOne of my favourite tasks when starting a new project is to perform exploratory data analysis. It gives me the opportunity to learn about the different variables before delving into the more ‘sciencey’ tasks.
Inside AirBnB have scraped public AirBnB data for various locations and made it available to the public. I’ve seen a number of people use these datasets for predictive analysis projects, but I want to focus on producing visualisations.</description>

      <description>This exercise uses the tidymodels package. I’ve watched a number of Julia Silge’s Tidy Tuesday videos but haven’t yet tried to conduct any machine learning using this package. This is my first time trying, and what better way to start than by looking at medical data. The data set can be found here.
Data ExplorationThere’s an obvious difference between those who have suffered from heart disease or hypertension and those who haven’t.</description>

      <description>My name is Rose Pegler and I am a data scientist at SHARE Creative. After a dull year working in audit, I set out to find something that I actually enjoyed and wanted to build a career with. With an interest in coding and a passion for tech, that search led me to the field of data science.
This blog&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to showcase my non-work related projects.</description>

      <description>Introduction + DataThis notebook has been produced as part of my first Kaggle competition. We are provided with a dataset containing around 7,000 tweets which may or may not relate to a real disaster that has occurred. There are only two other variables; keyword which contains a disaster-related keyword (or NA) and location which details the provided location of the tweet (also can be NA).</description>
