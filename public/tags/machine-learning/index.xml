      <description>Introduction + DataThis notebook has been produced as part of my first Kaggle competition. We are provided with a dataset containing around 7,000 tweets which may or may not relate to a real disaster that has occurred. There are only two other variables; keyword which contains a disaster-related keyword (or NA) and location which details the provided location of the tweet (also can be NA).</description>

      <description>This exercise uses the tidymodels package. I’ve watched a number of Julia Silge’s Tidy Tuesday videos but haven’t yet tried to conduct any machine learning using this package. This is my first time trying, and what better way to start than by looking at medical data. The data set can be found here.
Data ExplorationThere’s an obvious difference between those who have suffered from heart disease or hypertension and those who haven’t.</description>
