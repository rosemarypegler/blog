My name is Rose Pegler and I am a data scientist at [SHARE Creative](https://sharecreative.com/). After a dull year working in audit, I set out to find something that I actually enjoyed and wanted to build a career with. With an interest in coding and a passion for tech, that search led me to the field of data science.

After completing my masters at the University of Manchester in 2020, I started working for a company that encourages creativity. And with the pandemic causing several lockdowns, I finally had time to pick up that paintbrush that was put down too many years ago.

This blog's purpose is to showcase my non-work related projects.
